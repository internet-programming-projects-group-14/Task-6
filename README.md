# Vital-Signal QoE Mobile Application

## Overview

The Vital-Signal Quality of Experience (QoE) mobile application is a comprehensive telecommunications network monitoring system designed to capture, analyze, and visualize network performance metrics and user feedback. The system provides real-time insights into network service quality across different operators and locations.

## Project Description

This application serves as a data collection and analysis platform for telecommunications quality assessment. It combines automated network metric collection with user-provided feedback to generate comprehensive quality assessments and performance analytics.

## System Architecture

The application follows a three-tier architecture consisting of:
